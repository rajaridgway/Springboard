    "# Using Yelp Data to Recommend the Location of the Next Lou Malnati: Preprocessing, Training, and Modeling \n",
    "Chicago pizza magnate Lou Malnati is looking to expand his national pizza empire. With 59 locations in Illinois, seven in Arizona, four in Wisconsin, and four in Indiana. Malnati is interested in potentially expanding both within Arizona and Indiana and to other states. In particular, Malnati is interested in Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Missouri. \n",
    "Malnati’s restaurants are known for their deep dish pizza, and are looking for locations that either might not have deep dish options or locations where the pizza options are not satisfying consumers. Malnati's team believes that they can both introduce deep dish to new customers and lure currently unsatisfied customers with their nationally recognized pizza brand. \n",
    "Malnati’s team has requested an analysis of the existing landscape in the four new states along with Arizona and Indiana. They want to understand which state holds the most promise for more or more new locations. Ideally, they would like to open up multiple locations and want to know whether one of the new states would be a better option than continuing to open up restaurants in Arizona and Indiana.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The purpose of this notebook is to pre-process the data, to split the data into training and test sets, and to build and evaluate several models for predicting the star rating based on the comment.**"
